This is because within the event horizon the force of gravity is so strong that the speed required to escape a black hole is greater than the Universal speed limit - the speed of light. \n",

Below is an example of light from a background galaxy being deflected by a black holes gravity as it travels to our eyes.<!--- This makes the images of object nearby massive objects in space appear distorted. It also produces multiple images. You would see two duplicate images of the same star on opposite sides of the black hole, because light rays passing the black hole on either side get bent toward you. In fact, there are infinitely many images of each star, corresponding to light rays that circle the black hole several times before coming toward you.---> \n",
